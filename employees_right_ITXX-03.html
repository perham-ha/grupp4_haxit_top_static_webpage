		<b>Background: </b><br><p></p>
Bruce Banner was born to Dr. Brian Banner and his wife Rebecca. Brian was an alcoholic father whose jealousy grew for Bruce as Rebecca shifted her focus from Brian to Bruce,Further, Brian believed that his radiation work had altered his DNA and given him a mutant son. Brian then abused Bruce and finally murdered Rebecca, then was placed in a mental hospital. After that, Bruce was raised by his aunt and father's sister, Susan Banner, who understood his great pain and rage over his childhood sufferings thanks to his crazed father, and raised him with love and care as if he were her own child.
<br><p>
Eventually when he became an adult he was a genius in nuclear physics, but without the proper funding, he was forced to go to the Desert State University. While performing a Gamma Bomb test until he saw a random civilian, so he asked his assistant Igor to stop the bomb, however because Igor was with the Soviet Union, he refused. Bruce was able to find a place to protect the bystander however he wasn't able to get back to his former location when the Gamma Bomb went off.
<br><p>
Somehow, Bruce survived the explosion thanks to a genetic factor in his body. This factor allowed Bruce to absorb the gamma radiation and after that night, he would frequently transform into the Green Goliath, also known as the Hulk.

		<b>Strengths: </b><br><p></p>
Gamma Radiation Physiology: Due to Bruce Banner being exposed to the Gamma Bomb's radiation culminating in his transformation into a powerful monster, The Incredible Hulk was for several times described as one of the physically most powerful beings in the entire Marvel Universe, with the potential for limitless levels of strength and durability (which scales directly with his strength). The Hulk, in the full exercise of his potential, was described as the most powerful regular humanoid, and his maximum known strength level ranges beyond the limits of virtually any other known humanoid being. The gamma radiation mutated his body and fortified his cellular structure, adding over 800 lbs of bone marrow and muscle tissues to his body. Additionally, during times of stress the Hulk's adrenaline level escalates, causing a corresponding escalation of brute strength. Thus, the madder Hulk gets, the stronger Hulk gets. Moreover, the Hulk was stated to be an Omega Level Threat by both the Initiative and Mister Fantastic, and even "the Original Omega Level Threat" by Gyrich. At one point, the Hulk was stated to be the strongest hero in the world.

		<b>Weaknesses: </b><br><p></p>
Gamma Radiation Draining: The Hulk is sometimes portrayed as vulnerable to gamma radiation draining by sufficiently powerful energy manipulators. Reverting to human form may be necessary for the Hulk to recharge his gamma energy. However, the Hulk is eventually characterized as possessing high degree of immunity to this weakness. For example, the mutant Darwin was unable to drain his gamma radiation, and Hulk deliberately transferred his energy into an entire race of absorbing entities without collapsing. Even previous to these events the Hulk has displayed this potential. For example, the hero Rom was unable to cure Banner from his condition, and the Hulk intentionally overloaded the Armageddon absorption mechanism.

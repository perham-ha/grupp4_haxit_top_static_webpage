		<b>Background: </b><br><p></p>
Carasynthia "Cara" Dune was a human female Alderaanian who was a seasoned warrior and a marshal of the New Republic. She had previous military experience, having once been shock trooper in the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War, and was an intimidating brawler and a crack shot. She left the Alliance as it politically reformed into the New Republic and became a mercenary for hire. Dune was later hired by Greef Karga on Nevarro, before rising to become a marshal of the New Republic.
<br><p>
Dune was from Alderaan and was off-world when it was destroyed by the Galactic Empire using the DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station. She joined the Rebel Alliance during the Galactic Civil War and began hunting down warlords after the Battle of Endor. However, her duties changed and she began escorting delegates and suppressing riots, causing her to resign from the Alliance and go into early retirement

		<b>Strengths: </b><br><p></p>
A seasoned warrior[2] who had served as a rebel shock trooper,[3] Dune was a crack shot with a blaster and an intimidating brawler.[2] Highly skilled in hand-to-hand combatant, she was able to fight Din Djarin, an accomplished fighter in his own right, to a standstill during their first encounter.[3] Later, Dune fought a male Zabrak in a tavern on Sorgan, overpowering him and causing him to tap out. Her height sometimes belied her true strength, which she demonstrated by holding Djarin in an arm wrestling contest, confidently stating that he could not beat her.[11] During their first encounter, Dune was able to knock him to the ground with a single blow to his helmet.[3]

		<b>Weaknesses: </b><br><p></p>
Carasynthia Dune was a woman with shoulder-length and partially braided black hair, brown eyes, and a light skin tone.[2] She was 1.73 meters tall[4] with a muscular build. The tattoo of the Rebel starbird under her left eye was called a tear, by which she was recognized as a survivor of Alderaan.[16]
<br><p>
Not wanting to protect delegates or suppress riots, citing that it was not what she joined the rebellion for, Dune left the New Republic,[3] moved past her days of military discipline, and reinvented herself as a mercenary.[2] The destruction of her homeworld by the Empire left her with a virulent hatred of Imperials, to the extent that she immediately agreed to take part in a plan to kill the Client upon being informed that he was an Imperial, despite having repeatedly declined prior to learning that detail.[11] She was also unwilling to be captured by Moff Gideon, fearing the punishment that the Imperial remnant would inflict upon her. When Karga offered her a place in the Bounty Hunters' Guild, she expressed clerical concerns about her chain code, though Karga revealed they would be of no worry if she became his enforcer.[1]
<br><p>
Dune kept her emotions and personal feelings tightly under control, but the loss of her homeworld remained an open and sore wound.[16] When confronted by Carson Teva on Nevarro over whether she lost family there, Cara bitterly told him she lost "everyone."[7] When she rejoined military service as a marshal of the New Republic she was initially reluctant to do anything that would constitute an abuse of that position and power, she relented in the interest of saving Grogu and for another shot at the Empire.[12][15][16]
